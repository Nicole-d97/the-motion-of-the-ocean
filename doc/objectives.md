# Study Objectives 
* What is the relationship between microinvertabrate community composition and seasonality? 
  + Prediction: community composition will vary with changing seasons
- What is the relationship between water-body types, sites, community composition, and species richness? 
  + Prediction: community composition will be the same across sites with the same water-body type, and different acorss sites with     different water-body types. 
- What is the relationship between environmental conditions (pH, percipitation) across sites, community composition, and species richness? 
  + Prediction: Changing pH levels will affect species community composition and abundances.
