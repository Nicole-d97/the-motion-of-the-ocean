# Study Objectives 
* What is the relationship between macroinvertabrate community composition and seasonality across sites and water-body types? 
  + Prediction: Community composition will vary with changing seasons depending on water-body type due to differing conditions such as precipitation, runoff, temperature etc.
  + Prediction: Sites that experience more intense seasonality will have a greater variablity in community composition in comparison to those that experience milder seasons. 
* What is the relationship between water-body types, sites, community composition, and species richness? 
  + Prediction: Community composition will be the same across sites with the same water-body type (for eg. river vs. river), and different acorss sites with different water-body types (for eg. river vs. lake). 
  + Prediction: Water-body types are a greater predictor of community similarity or dissimilarity than sites. 
* What is the relationship between environmental conditions (pH, percipitation) across sites, water body types, community composition, and species richness? 
  + Prediction: Since pH is dependent on precipitation levels and other environmental variables (for eg. contaminant runoff), it will vary across sites and water body types. 
  + Prediction: Sites with lower pH will have lower species richness regardless of water body type. 
  + Prediction: Community composition will be more greatly affected by pH than water body type (i.e. if differences in pH between two rivers are large, community composition will also be significantly different).
