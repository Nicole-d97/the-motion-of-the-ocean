# Study Objectives 

Our study will aim to answer the questions below:

* What is the effect of pH, conductance, percent riperian cover, and anthropogenic land use on the diversity of macroinvertebrate communities in small streams? 
  + Prediction: Decreasing pH and percent riperian cover, and increasing conductance and land use has a negative effect on the diversity of macroinvertebrate communities.
 
* What is the effect of pH, conductance, and percent riperian cover on the evenness of macroinvertebrate communities in small streams? 
  + Prediction: Decreasing pH and percent riperian cover, and increasing conductance and land use has a negative effect on the diversity of macroinvertebrates, since not all species will thrive under stressful environmental conditions.
