# Possible analyses
### I. How to answer research questions 
For variable community composition, we plan to plot them with PCA and spatial autocorrelation, identify dominant genus (simpson's index), abundance/importance (if have over 10 genus).

	Dependent variables: community composition for each site, species richness, species evenness. 
	Independent variables includes: nutrient, pH, seasonality, substrate, dissolved oxygen, sites. 

We predict that the independent variables will affect the dependent variables, and conservation action will be dependent on the community composition, species richness and speices evenness of the sites. 

Use mixed models (or structure equation model) for the realationship between dependent variables and independent variables 

PCA of abundance - community composition for each site

MANOVA - community composition similarity across sites 

Spatial autocorrelation for sites with dependent variabels (pH, seasonality, substrate)


#### II. How do we formulate the data

 **Cleaning/transformation plan:**

Merge data from each year and season (all years, all sites, might take an average across the years)

New dataset with all required variables for linear mixed-model or model selection anaysis (spread genus information), including sites, year, all indepdendent and dependent variables in a wide-spread data sheet


#### III. what kinds of statistical approaches you anticipate employing
Principal component analysis (PCA)

Linear mixed model and model selection  

Spatial autocorrelation test 

ANOVA, MANOVA/PERMANOVA
