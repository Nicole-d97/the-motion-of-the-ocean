#1)	Measuring pH variability across sites and seasons
-	The effect of site, year, and season on pH:
o	Simple boxplots by sites and seasons: 3 for each site 
o	**somewhere in lecture** there is code that tests for 4 assumptions of normality – do that before running linear model 
o	Run multiple models with different structures: run AIC for the best structure 
o	Account for spatial autocorrelation 
o	Identify which variable to include as random effect (whatever the fixed effect is) 

#2)	Measuring conductance variability across sites and seasons
-	The effect of site, year, and season on conductance: 
o	Simple boxplots by sites and seasons: 3 for each site 
o	**somewhere in lecture** there is code that tests for 4 assumptions of normality – do that before running linear model 
o	Run multiple models with different structures: run AIC for the best structure 
o	Account for spatial autocorrelation 
o	Identify which variable to include as random effect (whatever the fixed effect is) 

#3)	Measuring Simpson’s Index across sites 
o	Convert species data to a matrix 
o	Spatial autocorrelation 
o	Use Simpson’s function to quantify richness 

#4)	Either linear model or mixed model to measure effect of pH on Species Richness 
o	Need to account for spatial autocorrelation from step 3 
o	Model structure will depend on results from step 1 

#5)	Either linear model or mixed model to measure effect of conductance on Species Richness 
o	Need to account for spatial autocorrelation from step 3 
o	Model structure will depend on results from step 2

#6)	Measuring Shannon’s Index across sites 
o	Convert species data to a matrix 
o	Spatial autocorrelation 
o	Use Simpson’s function to quantify richness 

## Evenness
```{r}
invert_evenness <- invert_genera %>%
  group_by(siteID, collectDate) %>%
  summarise(shannon = diversity(estimatedTotalCount, index = "shannon"),
            evenness = shannon/log(specnumber(estimatedTotalCount))) 
```

#7)	Either linear model or mixed model to measure effect of pH on Species evenness  
o	Need to account for spatial autocorrelation from step 3 
o	Model structure will depend on results from step 1 

#8)	Either linear model or mixed model to measure effect of conductance on Species evenness  
o	Need to account for spatial autocorrelation from step 3 
o	Model structure will depend on results from step 2

#9)	Create dataset for % Riparian Cover 
o	Change Y/N for landuse to 0 and 1 and get mean = call this column “% landuse” 
o	Only keep: mean riparian cover for each site and this new column

#10)	Measure correlation between %Riparian Cover and other variables 
o	Measure correlation between riparian cover, land use, seasonality and site 
o	Account for spatial autocorrelation 
o	Identify which variable to include as random effect (whatever the fixed effect is) 

#11)	Either linear or mixed model to measure the effect of riparian cover on species richness 
o	Need to account for spatial autocorrelation from step 3 
o	Model structure will depend on results from step 2

#12)	Either linear model or mixed model to measure effect of riparian cover on Species evenness  
o	Need to account for spatial autocorrelation from step 3 
o	Model structure will depend on results from step 2
