PH.FINAL.GEO. csv dataset contains the pH and conductance information for 15 sites in csv format:
POSE, KING, MCDI, LECO, MAYF, PRIN, BLDE, COMO, WLOU, SYCA, REDB, MART, MCRA, BIGC, CARI, TECR.
1 site was excluded due to lack of data: OKSR.
It contains the mean pH, mean conductance, and geographic coordniates. 
It also contains the Rmd file used to create the CSV file. 

RIP.FINAL.GEO.csv dataset contains the riparian information for 15 sites in csv format:
POSE, KING, MCDI, LECO, MAYF, PRIN, BLDE, COMO, WLOU, SYCA, REDB, MART, MCRA, BIGC, CARI, TECR.
1 site was excluded due to lack of data: OKSR.
It contains the percent canopy cover, land use, and geographic coordinates. 
It also contains the Rmd file used to create the CSV file. 

Invert_genera.csv contains the genus identification, life stage information, counts in the sample,
estimated total counts, whether or not species were identified, whether or not the taxa was identified,
the name of the laboratory that the taxonomic information were identified in, and the name of the person 
who identified the samples for the various sites sampled at multiple occasions. 
It also contains columns for the latitude and longitude of sampling sites to 5 decimal points.

The invert_genera_season dataset contains taxonomy data form invert_genera and added the columns of 
year and season to it for all observations from 15 sites in csv format: 
POSE, KING, MCDI, LECO, MAYF, PRIN, BLDE, COMO, WLOU, SYCA, REDB, MART, MCRA, BIGC, CARI,
which matches the sites for pH dataset. 
There is also a rmd file used to create the dataset.
