# Introduction to the project
This project will aim to answer questions about the relationship between aquatic communities and their environment, as well as the interaction among the various species in the community. We are interested in seeing how spatial and temporal changes in conditions shape communities, and the macroinvertabrate dataset that we have chosen seem to be a good fit for exploring our objective. We will be using data collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network on macroinvertebrate communities and environmental variables we felt were relevant. In addition to the scientific goal we are also interested in trying to develop some statistical skills and gain more experiences with R, and this project will be a good exercise. 

# Description of the data
We will be using data from the National Ecological Observatory Network's open data portal. The macroinvertebrates data was collected from all aquatic sites in the National Ecological Observatory Network. This data set includes data collected from July  2014 to October 2019, with three sampling events per year. In addition to the macroinvertebrates data, we will also use data on environmental variables such as precipitation and pH. The macroinvertebrates data includes counts of the individuals sampled, as well as the taxonomic information and morphometric data. From these data set, we will use species identity and taxonomic information, abundance, time of year, location of sites, precipitation, and pH as the variables to answer our broad research question of how spatial and and temporal changes in conditions shape macroinvertebrate communities.

# Team description

## Eve
Eve is a 4th year student who is double majoring in EEB and Neuroscience. Her skills include making plots, linear mixed models, and selecting models. For this project, she is responsible for the model selection and making plots, as well as preliminary data exploration which will be done independently by every team member.

## Nicole
Nicole is a 4th year EEB specialist, whose skills include data wrangling, making plots, and some mathematical modeling. She also has spatial statistics skills she is learning through her undergrad thesis course. She is responsible for leading the spatial statistics portion of the project, as well as the preliminary data exploration.

## Sarah
Sarah is a 3rd year student with majors in EEB and Conservation, and her skills include working with ggplot, multivariate stats, and making figures. She is responsible for leading the multivariate stats portion of the project along with Youngseo, making plots with Eve, as well as the preliminary data exploration.

## Youngseo
Youngseo is a 4th year student in EEB specialist, whose skills include making plots, some mathematical modeling she learned from an EEB course, some basic statistics knowledge and multivariate stats. She is responsible for leading the multivariate stats portion of the project with Sarah, as well as some spatial statistics work.
