- Question 2: What is the relationship between water-body types, sites, community composition, and species richness? 
  + mock plot 2 caption: The x and y axes represent the principle component axes of community composition. The PC axes were generated by doing a principle components analyses of the genuses sampled at each site. The points are colored by the type of waterbody. 
- Question 3: What is the relationship between pH, species richness, and community composition across sites and water body types: 
  + mock plot 3 caption: the x and y axes represent the principle component axes of community composition. The two clusters are colored by pH level. 
  + mock plot 3a caption: Species richness plotted versus pH for two body types: river and lake.
